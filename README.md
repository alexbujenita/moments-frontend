# Moments

Allowing people to find the best photographers for their needs, and photographers to be seen by people.

## Why?
I tried putting together two things that I really love, programming and photography.
I also wanted to try to solve a common _issue_ which is finding the right person to immortalize your best moments.

## How to run
Since I'm using AWS secrets I'm skipping this part.
## What is this about?
As a user this app requires no registration and allows you to browse the full catalogue of photographers with their works, also you can contact a photographer to get more info.

As a photographer you can create an account with us and build your own portfolio page, manage your picures (up to six), see potential client's messages and personalize your bio.

I tried building an app with many features such as:
* Routes in React, for better user experience
* Use of hashed passwords
* JWT for authentification and authorization
* Use of validations on models
* AWS file uploads from React
* Personalised 404 page when incorrect address is typed

The GIF below demonstrates the app from the user's point of view
